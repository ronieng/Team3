    <b> Krazy Colour Instructions </b>
    <p> Krazy Colour Water Soluble Dyes can be used in bath bombs, soaps, candles and more! </p>
    <p> The most important thing to do is to ensure that the dye is dissolved properly! </p>
    <p> </p>
    <b> Make a solution: </b>
    <ul>
    <li> Weigh out the required quantity of dye. </li>
    <li> Make a paste using cold water.</li>
    <li> Add hot water to this paste while stirring.</li>
    <li> Continue to stir until the dye is completely dissolved.</li>
    <li> Allow to cool. </li>
    <li> The dye is now ready to use. </li>
    <li> The stability of solutions are good provided they are kept in a cool place and not exposed to direct sunlight.</li>
    </ul>

    <b> The points to take note are: </b>
    <ul>
    <li> Dyes have varying solubility. </li>
    <li> Adding cold water and making a paste ensures that water can easily get to the surface of the dyes.  This is especially important when using powders. </li>
    <li> The hot water adds energy into the dissolving process forcing the dye to dissolve quicker.  The temperature of the water has no effect on the dye.  They were all originally designed for dyeing textiles at 95Â°C.</li>
    <li> The stirring ensures that there is good contact between the dye and the water and accelerates the dissolving step. </li>
    <li> This can be done by adding cold water. </li>
    <li> Make sure to handle the dye solution carefully as dyes can be messy! </li>
    <li> If you are going to store the solutions  and use the dyes in food then you may consider adding a preservative. </li>
    </ul>
